# News-Classification
This project aims to classify news articles into predefined categories using machine learning models like Feedforward Neural Networks (FFNN) and Bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM). The dataset undergoes preprocessing, label encoding, and feature extraction to improve accuracy. Model performance is evaluated using precision, recall, and F1-score. Hyperparameter tuning helps optimize classification accuracy. Comparative analysis determines the best-performing model for real-world applications.
